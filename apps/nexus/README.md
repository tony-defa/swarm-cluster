## Other notes
### Backup
Unlike some other stacks, there is no backup service with the nexus stack. A backup task to backup the underlying database and configuration can be configured within the settings of nexus. Follow the official instructions to setup a backup task: https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/planning-your-implementation/backup-and-restore/configure-and-run-the-backup-task

A backup volume is made available with the `HOST_NEXUS_BACKUP` environment variable. The mount point within the docker container is `/backup`.

The `cleanup` service is used to delete old backup files, within that backup volume. Use the `RETENTION_DAYS` variable to periodically remove backup files older then the given amount of days.

### Restore
To restore the exported databases follow the instructions here: https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/planning-your-implementation/backup-and-restore/restore-exported-databases
