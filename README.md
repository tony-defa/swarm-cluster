# Swarm Cluster
A set of docker compose files describing how the server applications should run. Clone this project to one of the master nodes of the cluster and configure according to this documentation.

## Create docker swarm
Follow the steps described here: [Swarm Tutorial: Create a Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/)

## Project structure
The structure is divided into different categories. These are described in the following paragraphs. Each category should contain a `README.md`-file describing the stacks within the category.

### System
This contains system relevant services.

### Apps
These are private or publicly obtained apps that add to the value of the cluster.

### Mustache
A tentative at making the stack files more dynamic by trying to create the stack file from a mustache template. This also allows to create multiple stacks from the same template.

### Jobs
Tasks or jobs can be stored here.

## Preparing the stack

There are a few general steps necessary to deploy a stack. In some cases further prerequisites are described in the `README.md`-file of the stack directory.

The following paragraphs describe the general steps to take when starting a stack.

### 1. Environment files
Folders may contain an `example.env` file that requires some attention before a stack can be deployed. If such a file is present in the folder, run the following command first:

```sh
cd folder-of-interest/
cp example.env .env
```

Now the newly created file needs to be edited and configured according to the cluster. 

### 2. Copy data folder
For a service to run properly, it might be necessary to copy or create a pre-configured data folder to the host path location defined in the `.env`-file. Find the instructions for this step in the `README.md` file of the stack. In that case create the data folder as described [below](#manual-deployment-process-alternative).

### 3. Create docker secrets
In terms of Docker Swarm services, a secret is a blob of data, such as a password, SSH private key, SSL certificate, or another piece of data that should not be transmitted over a network or stored unencrypted in a Dockerfile or in your applicationâ€™s source code. You can use Docker secrets to centrally manage this data and securely transmit it to only those containers that need access to it.

To create a docker secret simply use the following command.

```sh
printf "someSecret" | docker secret create <name_of_secret> -
```

### 4. Create networks
It may be necessary to create one or more docker networks to run a stack. If this is the case, you'll find the instruction in the `README.md` of the stack folder.

## Deploying a stack

You can deploy a stack either by using the provided helper script (recommended) or by following the manual process.


>### One-time script installation (recommended)
>
>To simplify deployments and automate common pre-deployment steps (like handling `.env` files and `HOST_` paths), install the `deploy-stack` script once on your manager node:
>
>```bash
>sudo cp deploy-stack.sh /usr/bin/deploy-stack
>sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/deploy-stack
>```
>
>Make sure `deploy-stack` is accessible in your PATH (e.g., `/usr/bin`) so you can run it from any directory.


### ðŸš€ Deploy using the helper script (recommended)

**Run the deployment script**

   ```bash
   deploy-stack <stack-file.yml> [stack-name]
   ```

   - `<stack-file.yml>`: your compose file (e.g., `spec-proxy.yml`)
   - `[stack-name]`: custom stack name; if omitted, the script uses the filename (without extension)

The script will:

- Detect and parse `.env` if present in the stack directory
- Create any `HOST_â€¦` folders that donâ€™t yet exist and set their group to `docker`
- Deploy the stack with `docker compose ... config | docker stack deploy ...`

---

### Manual deployment process (alternative)

**Create Configured `HOST` paths**

The `.env`-file may contain paths that need to be created before the execution of the stack. These are variables that start with `HOST_`. To create these folders, run the following commands:

```sh
cd folder-of-interest/
cat .env | grep "^HOST_[A-Z]" | cut -d'=' -f2 | xargs sudo mkdir -p
cat .env | grep "^HOST_[A-Z]" | cut -d'=' -f2 | xargs sudo chown -R :docker 
```

> Use the `sudo` command (after the last pipe) for directories that do not reside in your home directory. Omit `sudo` otherwise.
> For NFS configuration: Use `nobody:nogroup` as owner for the created directories with the `chown` command.

**Finally deploy the stack**

Having done all the previous steps correctly, you can now deploy a stack by simply running the following command, if an `.env`-file is associated with the stack :

```sh
cd folder-of-interest/
env -i $(cat .env | grep "^[A-Z]" | xargs) docker stack deploy -c stack-file.yml stack-name
```

or omit the `env` part of the command, if there is no `.env`-file associated with the stack:

```sh
cd folder-of-interest/
docker stack deploy -c stack-file.yml stack-name
```
